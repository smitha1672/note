    the company's growth is limited by economic problem.

    I am searching new opportunity and cooperation relationship from different countries.

# Tell me about yourself.
    Well, I'd describe myself as a passionate person with a professional skill-set in EE,
    great communication skills, and I am a team player.

    I normally divide one week time to 2 parts:
    On weekend:
    I take a lot time engage with my childrens.
    Assembling LEGO, playing TV game, hanging out in famous view place...etc

    On working days:
    I study with "LINUX program design", "LINUX shell script", "data structure in C"...etc
    in my spare time.

    Recently, I am reading "computer systems a programmers's perspective" that talks about
    "machine level repersentation of programs", "processer architecture", "optimizing program performace"...
    etc.

    I am presently working as staff firmware engineer at CYWEE MOTION
    algorithm company. I am in charge of CWYEE MOTION sensor hub projec.

    My responsibilities include:
    Customer's functionalities requirement, coordinating, implementation, debugging, evaluation.
    Assisting team members, I help them to fix problem from challenges.

    In the pervious job, I designed 5.1 channels sound bar audio system and got "CES Best Home Theater Award" in AMTRAN company.

    The kind of job in which your company is engaged particularly interests me, and
    I would welcome the opportunity it would afford to use my vairous abilities
